# Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow

## Project Overview

This project uses a TensorFlow-based model to classify text into positive or negative sentiments. It utilizes LSTM layers for sequence modeling, and the dataset can be any sentiment-labeled text data (e.g., IMDb movie reviews or Twitter data).

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `src/`: Main Python source code including data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for key components.
- `scripts/`: Scripts to run tasks like downloading data and training the model.
- `saved_models/`: Directory where the trained models are saved.
- `logs/`: Logs generated during model training.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
